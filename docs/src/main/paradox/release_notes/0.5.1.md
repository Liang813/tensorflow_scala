# Release 0.5.1

This release introduces support for TensorFlow 2.2 and
Scala 2.13 and drops support for Scala 2.11. The
distributed precompiled binaries for this version will only
work with CUDA 10.1 on Linux. Finally, this release also
brings improved support for implicit derivations in some
cases where case classes over tensors are used.
